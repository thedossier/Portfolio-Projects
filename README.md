# Portfolio-Projects

Seeing this kind of work in action is not easy. Even seeing the code can be difficult to 
understand if you are unfamiliar with the language. I have added notes and walked through
different processes to showcase different ways data analysis can be performed.

The beauty is there are multiple ways to tackle these problems. These are fun (for me at least)
examples to see what's possible.

I do plan to continue to add projects as I find more intriguing ways to analyze data. These
also help me better hone my skills explaining what I am doing and why. It's very easy to 
glance over important information that is assumed to be understood. When sometimes, even
often, it is not understood by others that do not analyse data regularly.
